	abstract = {Device-to-Device (D2D) communication was initially proposed in cellular networks as a new paradigm to enhance network performance. The emergence of new applications such as content distribution and location-aware advertisement introduced new use-cases for D2D communications in cellular networks. The initial studies showed that D2D communication has advantages such as increased spectral efficiency and reduced communication delay. However, this communication mode introduces complications in terms of interference control overhead and protocols that are still open research problems. The feasibility of D2D communications in LTE-A is being studied by academia, industry, and the standardization bodies. To date, there are more than 100 papers available on D2D communications in cellular networks and, there is no survey on this field. In this article, we provide a taxonomy based on the D2D communicating spectrum and review the available literature extensively under the proposed taxonomy. Moreover, we provide new insights to the over-explored and under-explored areas which lead us to identify open research problems of D2D communication in cellular networks.},

	abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) in cellular networks is a promising concept which opens up new opportunities for commercial applications but also brings new challenges for network management. In this paper, we propose a tractable hybrid network model where the positions of transceivers are modeled by random spatial Poisson point processes (PPP). Further, we develop a unified analytical approach which allows a unified capacity evaluation for different D2D deployment scenarios including overlay in-band D2D, underlay in-band D2D and out-of-band D2D. We further consider two important questions in the overlay case: 1) how to partition the spectrum between cellular and D2D transmissions, and 2) what is the optimal threshold for distance-based D2D mode selection? Similarly, we jointly study the optimal accessible spectrum fraction and mode selection threshold in the underlay case.},

	abstract = {A constant need to increase the network capacity for meeting the growing demands of the subscribers has led to the evolution of cellular communication networks from the first generation (1G) to the fifth generation (5G). There will be billions of connected devices in the near future. Such a large number of connections are expected to be heterogeneous in nature, demanding higher data rates, lesser delays, enhanced system capacity and superior throughput. The available spectrum resources are limited and need to be flexibly used by the mobile network operators (MNOs) to cope with the rising demands. An emerging facilitator of the upcoming high data rate demanding next generation networks (NGNs) is device-to-device (D2D) communication. An extensive survey on device-to-device (D2D) communication has been presented in this paper, including the plus points it offers, the key open issues associated with it like peer discovery, resource allocation etc, demanding special attention of the research community, some of its integrant technologies like millimeter wave D2D (mmWave), ultra dense networks (UDNs), cognitive D2D, handover procedure in D2D and its numerous use cases. Architecture is suggested aiming to fulfill all the subscriber demands in an optimal manner.

	abstract = {We are interested in the phenomenology of cities by restricting them to the geometry of their street network. This study aims at being synthetic, functional and interdisciplinary. It follows the large work that has been performed from the early XXth century by town-planners, social scientists, geographers, statisticians, physicists. We try to demonstrate that the street - as a coherent alignment of street segments - can be considered as an essential elementary structure of the city. How much information is encoded in the street network ? To what extent does it constraint the city use ? How are the current urban layout and its evolution determined jointly by traffic axis and structuring elements ? We present a mathematical and computational framework allowing to consider the map of a city as a geometric continuum associated to the topology of a planar graph. To this graph we juxtapose a hypergraph structure using the street geometry to obtain easily the notion of axis and a multi-scale representation of the city. In spite of an apparent shape diversity, we show that the street network of a city is subjected to general laws that leave hallmarks on a city map. We propose several morphogenesis models of the city, implementing the idea that the city's growth follows a strucured extension / division of space logic and able to reproduce hallmarks observed on actual maps. The understanding of regulation mechanism of the city allows us to propose functional algorithms whose computational efficiencies are very interesting. We present an algorithm recovering steets from a collection of street segments ; the notion of simplest centrality whose calculus on a map allows a hierarchical analysis of it, revealing for instance main trafic axis and ill-deserved area ; a fast approximative algorithm to find the shortest path between two random points ; and a Spectral Clustering based algorithm to produce morphological segmentations of maps. We also work on the identification of random tessellation models to be subtituted to an actual road network and to solve large optimization problems using statistical equivalence.},

	abstract = {The present thesis is motivated by a joint research project of the Institute of Stochastics at Ulm University and Orange Labs in Issy les Moulineaux, Paris, which deals with the analysis of telecommunication networks. During the last years the Stochastic Subscriber Line Model (SSLM) has been developed in this cooperation and it is still extended. The SSLM is a flexible model for telecommunication networks, especially designed for access networks in urban areas. It utilizes tools from Stochastic Geometry in order to represent the different parts of the network by spatial stochastic models which only depend on a small number of parameters. 
The aim of this thesis is to analyze so-called typical connection lengths in the SSLM in various ways. One part of the thesis focuses on the estimation of their densities and distribution functions via Monte-Carlo simulation. The developed estimators are all based on samples of the so-called typical serving zone. Therefore, simulation algorithms for the typical serving zone are derived for various network models. Another part of the thesis deals with limit theorems for the typical connection length. In particular, it is shown that the distribution of the typical connection length
converges to well-known distributions if the parameters of the underlying network model tend to extremal cases. Both results, the estimated distributions and the asymptotic distributions, are used in order to obtain approximative parametric densities for the typical connection length. These parametric densities are finally compared to empirical distributions computed from huge databases without using any spatial information. It is shown that the obtained parametric densities fit quite well to real network data. In the final part of the thesis,  required capacities at different locations of the network are analyzed.},

of information that may be desirable (for use with other BibTeX styles).
In particular, full names (not abbreviated with initials) should be
entered whenever possible as some (non-IEEE) bibliography styles use
full names. IEEEtran.bst will automatically abbreviate when it encounters

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
